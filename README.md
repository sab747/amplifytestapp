# Hack-A-Thing: React App w/AWS Amplify

### Sabrina Jain, CS98 F21

## Description

I attempted to build a React app w/authentication and file storage using AWS Amplify. 

To run locally, navigate to root project directory in a terminal and enter the command: 'npm start'

## What you learned

I learned the basics of how to quickly build an application using React, which I have never used before. I also learned how to use AWS Amplify in conjunction with React to add authentication + file storage (additionally got experience using different AWS products than those I've previously used/worked on). I also learned that front-end development/making things look pretty is difficult and not exactly my fort√© (lots of room to improve my skills). I have very minimal experience with full-stack develop so following this tutorial/doing this activity was very worthwhile (especially since I want to build some sort of app as part of my CS98 project).

## What didn't work

I can't get real-time song uploads to work. Specifically, I had a hard time uploading mp3 files using the app (something about how I had the key formatted did not line up with the files on my computer).
